For those who grow up close to the Chaos Wastes,\nthere is little distinction made between a warrior who has\nbeen warped by Chaos, and any other fighter, save that the\nChaos-tainted one is likely to be more powerful and thus\nfavoured by the Gods. A Chaos Marauder serves Chaos,\nbut is more concerned with the loot he can take and the\ndevastation he can cause while raiding. Chaos Marauders use\nclassic skirmisher tactics. Their main aim is to grab as much\nloot as possible, leaving a trail of corpses and devastation\nbehind them. Since they are raiders by nature, they favour\nsoft targets. If met with serious opposition, they look for\neasier prey elsewhere. Chaos Marauders only stick around\nfor a stand-up fight if part of a larger force or if following a\nstrong leader.\nDepending on the tribe, Chaos Marauders may or may\nnot be mounted. Many of the Norse tribes use horses only\noccasionally, perhaps stealing them for transport but not\nusing them in war. In contrast, the Kurgan and Hung\ntribesmen ride into battle if at all possible, being superb\nhorsemen. Tribes that do field cavalry often arm them with\nhurled weapons such as javelins.",

    "description": "Giant Wolves are huge grey animals, standing close to\nfour feet at the shoulder. They are large enough that both\nHobgoblins and Goblins can use them as cavalry mounts.\nGiant Wolves fear very little, and are quite prepared to\nattack Humans if they think the latter are at all weak.\nGiant Wolves tend to run in packs with around seven\nmembers when they are not being used as Greenskin\nmounts. Classic Giant Wolf tactics involve the use of two\nor even three separate groups of wolves, with one group\nchasing the prey into the waiting jaws of the others. A\nvariant of this old wolf trick, used more by Giant Wolves than their more normal-sized counterparts, is the feigned\nretreat. Here, a small group of Giant Wolves will appear to\nflee their foes, only to lead them into an ambush.",
