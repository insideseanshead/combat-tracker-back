For those who grow up close to the Chaos Wastes,\nthere is little distinction made between a warrior who has\nbeen warped by Chaos, and any other fighter, save that the\nChaos-tainted one is likely to be more powerful and thus\nfavoured by the Gods. A Chaos Marauder serves Chaos,\nbut is more concerned with the loot he can take and the\ndevastation he can cause while raiding. Chaos Marauders use\nclassic skirmisher tactics. Their main aim is to grab as much\nloot as possible, leaving a trail of corpses and devastation\nbehind them. Since they are raiders by nature, they favour\nsoft targets. If met with serious opposition, they look for\neasier prey elsewhere. Chaos Marauders only stick around\nfor a stand-up fight if part of a larger force or if following a\nstrong leader.\nDepending on the tribe, Chaos Marauders may or may\nnot be mounted. Many of the Norse tribes use horses only\noccasionally, perhaps stealing them for transport but not\nusing them in war. In contrast, the Kurgan and Hung\ntribesmen ride into battle if at all possible, being superb\nhorsemen. Tribes that do field cavalry often arm them with\nhurled weapons such as javelins.",

Giants\nare wildly unpredictable foes. Sometimes they lash about\nwith their tree-size clubs, while other times they’ll pick up\ntheir smaller opponents and hurl them back into the fray.\nTheir ability to casually pick up and crush fully armoured\nknights lingers long in the minds of those who’ve had to\nfight them.",
